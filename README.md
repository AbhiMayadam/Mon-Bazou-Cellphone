### Mon Bazou Cellphone
This is my attempt at making a mod for Mon Bazou. I figured that the player deserves an in-game cellphone as they did exist in 2005. I am modeling this after the Sony Ericsson T610 for two reasons, it was released in 2003 so it would be era appropriate for the character to own, and I personally have one so I have a perfect reference.
